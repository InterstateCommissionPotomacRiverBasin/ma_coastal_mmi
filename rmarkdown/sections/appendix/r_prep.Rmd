The statistical language, R [@RCoreTeamlanguageenvironmentstatistical2017], was used to for data preparation, analyses, and the development of this document. R is a free open source language with a large library of packages (extensions of the base language) for data analysis.

__R Markdown__ is used to integrate text and code. The intention is to provide a more readable document, with better descriptions of how and why an activity was performed, than a standard R script with a few commented lines. Although my hope is that readers without any R background could comprehend the R code in this document with a little bit of patience, this document is really intended for readers with at least a basic understanding of R programming. 

Additionally, I am a big fan of the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) developed by the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) team and use these packages frequently throughout the document. The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) is essentially an ecosystem of packages that work well together and often make it easier to deal with data in R. For R users who do not use packages from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), I think many of the functions will be intuitive or easy to quickly search for online. However, I often find that the pipe operator, `%>%`, from the [magrittr package](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) is confusing to those unfamiliar with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), and right fully so. It takes a little while to wrap your head around the pipe operator but once you do I think you will find its use makes R code more legible. In essence, base R works from the inside-out, while the pipe operator presents the code in a linear fashion. For example, imagine you have a character vector `x` and you want to trim leading/trailing white space, then keep only unique strings, and then make all characters lowercase. In base R, the code would look this: `tolower(unique(trimws(x)))`. Again, base R works from the inside-out, so first `trimws()` is used to remove leading/trailing white space, then `unique()` is used to remove duplicate strings, and finally `tolower()` is used to convert all characters to lowercase. Using the pipe operator, the code would look like this: `x %>% trimws() %>%  unique() %>% tolower()`. The pipe operator presents the functions in the order you intend them to be performed; therefore, the code should be easier to read and more intuitive, which should in turn reduce errors. For more information on the pipe operator please refer to [http://magrittr.tidyverse.org/](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org/).

## Download and Edit this Document

This document can be downloaded and edited from my [GitHub account](https://github.com/zsmith27/bibi_baseline). As stated in the previous section, this document was created using __R Markdown__, so that the code could be integrated with descriptive text. The document is broken up into multiple children documents in the "markdown/sections" folder, which are all compiled together using the "master.Rmd" parent document. For small corrections, the easiest way to inform me will be to [open a new issue on the GitHub repository for this document](https://github.com/zsmith27/bibi_baseline/issues). However, my hope is that there will be others interested in becoming more involved, of whom I can add as collaborators to the Git Hub repository. [RStudio has made it very easy to connect R projects to GitHub](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN). Using these tools, it can be very easy to "push" and "pull" edits, while maintaining a record of the documents history. If you are interested in collaborating on this document, please contact me, [Zachary M. Smith](https://www.potomacriver.org/about-us/staff/).

### How to Download from GitHub

For those interested in collaborating, please [install the latest version of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio interacts well with GitHub and some aspects of this document may depend on the RStudio IDE. Next create a new project:

1. Create a new project (File -> New Project).
2. Select Version Control and Git (Version Control -> Git).
    + If you receive a message say "Git Not Found", then you need to install Git ([Install Git Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)). Once Git is installed, try setting up the project again in RStudio.
    + I believe RStudio should automatically recognize Git on your computer but I had to specify where the git.exe was located by going to _Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN -> locate git.exe (my file path: "C:/Users/zsmith/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/bin/git.exe")_.
3. Paste the bibi_baseline repository URL (https://github.com/zsmith27/bibi_baseline) into the "Repository URL" box.
4. Use the "Create project as subdirectory of:" box to manage where you want to store the project on your computer.

### Compile the Document

To view the html document you must compile the document using Knit. Follow these steps to Knit the document:

1. Open *master.Rmd* in *bibi_baseline/markdown*.
2. Find and click the Knit button (it looks like a ball of yarn) in the toolbar above the editor window.
    + If a window appears saying "Install Required Packages" for R Markdown, install the necessary packages for knitting the document.
3. Hopefully the document will compile correctly. If the document does not compile correctly, try to interpret and correct for the error message returned. If you cannot interpret the error message, please [open a new issue on the GitHub repository for this document](https://github.com/zsmith27/bibi_baseline/issues) and I will try to help you resolve the issue.

The dependency management system package, __packrat__, is used in this project to make it possible to replicate the results in this document one other computers and if the project is revisited in several years. As packages are updated functions may become defunct or a function may not respond in a similar fashion to previous versions of the package. When collaborating or revisiting the document sometime in the future, it is difficult to re-create the exact environment used by a collaborator or by past-you to create the document. __packrat__ aims to take a snapshot of the current and environment so it can be easily reproduced. As an added bit of precaution, `sessionInfo()` is printed to provide the necessary information for re-creating the environment if __packrat__ fails.
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Data for this document are located in various files. The object `project.dir` represents this R-projects root directory and will be used as the root of the file path throughout the document.
```{r}
project.dir <- rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()
```

## Custom Functions

The `clean_string()` function modifies character objects by removing leading/trailing white space, converting all characters to lower case, and replacing all spaces (" ") with an underscore ("_"). These specifications eliminate common typos and standardize character objects.
```{r}
clean_string <- function(x) {
  x %>% 
    stringr::str_trim() %>% 
    tolower() %>% 
    stringr::str_replace_all("\\s+", " ") %>% 
    stringr::str_replace_all(" ", "_") %>%  
    if_else(. == "", as.character(NA), .)
}
```

The `clean_up()` function is a wrapper for `clean_string()`. This function applies `clean_string()` to the column headers and character columns of data frames. Again, this process standardizes character values and makes it easier work with the data.
```{r}
clean_up <- function(x) {
  x %>% 
    rename_all(clean_string) %>% 
    mutate_if(is.character, funs(clean_string))%>% 
    distinct()
}
```
